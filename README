The documentation is built as part of the build process. If you can't access
the documentation online, try reading the unformatted documentation in
doc/mlsgpu-user-manual.xml.

For the very impatient (who have all the dependencies installed):
$ python waf configure --variant=release
$ python waf
$ sudo python waf install
