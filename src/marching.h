/**
 * Marching tetrahedra algorithm implemented in OpenCL.
 * An instance of this class contains buffers to hold intermediate state,
 * and is specialized for a specific OpenCL context and device. An instance
 * also currently specialized to the dimensions of the sampling grid, although
 * that could easily be changed to allow smaller jobs.
 *
 * At present, it has the following features and limitations:
 *  - The values are supplied by a functor that is called to enqueue work to produce
 *    a single slice as a 2D image. This allows the algorithm to work even if the entire
 *    grid is too large to fit in memory.
 *  - Where a non-finite value is present in the field, all adjacent cells are discarded.
 *    This can lead to boundaries in the surface.
 *  - The output is mostly polygon soup. The common vertices within each cell are
 *    represented only once, but vertices are not shared between cells.
 *
 * The implementation operates on a slice at a time. For each slice, it:
 *  -# Identifies the cells that are not empty (not entirely inside, entirely
 *     outside, or containing non-finite values).
 *  -# Compacts those cells into an array to allow more efficient iteration over them.
 *  -# Extracts the number of vertices and indices each (compacted) cell will produce.
 *  -# Performs of these counts to allocate positions in the array. These scans are
 *     seeded with the total number already produced.
 *  -# Generates the vertices and indices.
