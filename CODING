- Classes, structs and enums use InterCaps.
- Methods, functions, member variables and variables use camelCase.
- Filenames use lowercase_with_underscores.

However, where implementing concepts from another API (e.g. STL), the
conventions of that API may be used. For example, a function object should
define its result type as result_type, not ResultType.
